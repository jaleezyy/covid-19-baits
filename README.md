## SARS-CoV-2 Bait Capture Platform

# Abstract

> For a full description, see PREPRINT ULR

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betacoronavirus and the etiological agent of the current 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak that originated in Hubei Province, China. While polymerase chain reaction and cultural based methods are the front line tools for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, application of amplification-free and culture-free methods for isolation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, partnered with next generation sequencing, would provide a useful tool for both surveillance and research of SARS-CoV-2. We here release into the public domain a set of bait capture hybridization probe sequences for enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in complex biological samples. These probe sequences have been designed using rigorous bioinformatics methods to provide sensitivity, accuracy, and minimal off-target hybridization. Probe design was based on existing, validated approaches for detection of antimicrobial resistance genes in complex samples and it is our hope that this SARS-CoV-2 bait capture platform, once validated by those with samples in hand, will be of aid in combating the current outbreak.

# SARS-CoV-2 bait capture platform probe set

The complete set of SARS-CoV-2 bait capture platform probe are available [here](./fasta-files/proposed_probe_set). The header of each sequence reflects the reference sequence / start co-ordinate / stop co-oridinate from which the probe was defined by the design pipeline, e.g.
